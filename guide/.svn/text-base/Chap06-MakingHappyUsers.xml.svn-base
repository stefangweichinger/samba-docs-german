	<para>
	In the world of computer networks, problems are as varied as the people who create them
	or experience them. The design of the network implemented in the last chapter may 
	create problems for some network users. The following lists some of the problems that
	may occur:
	</para>

	<variablelist>

	    </indexterm>
		When a Windows client logs onto the network, many data packets are exchanged
		between the client and the server that is providing the network logon services.
		Each request between the client and the server must complete within a specific
		time limit. This is one of the primary factors that govern the installation of
	    <indexterm>
	      <primary>multiple domain controllers</primary>
	    </indexterm>
		multiple domain controllers (usually called secondary or backup controllers).
		As a rough rule, there should be one such backup controller for every
		30 to 150 clients. The actual limits are determined by network operational
		characteristics. 
		</para>

		<para>
		If the domain controller provides only network logon services
		and all file and print activity is handled by Domain Member servers, one Domain	
		Controller per 150 clients on a single network segment may suffice. In any
		case, it is highly recommended to have a minimum of one Domain Controller (PDC or BDC)
		per network segment. It is better to have at least one BDC on the network
		segment that has a PDC. If the Domain Controller is also used as a file and
		print server, the number of clients it can service reliably is reduced
		and a common rule is not to exceed 30 machines (Windows workstations plus
		Domain Member servers) per Domain Controller.

				Excessive delays in the resolution of a NetBIOS name to its IP

				Defective networking hardware. Over the past few years, we have seen

		No matter what the cause, a sudden operational loss of access to network resources can
		result in BSOD (blue screen of death) situations that necessitate rebooting of the client
		workstation. In the case of a mild problem, retrying to access the network drive of printer
		may restore operations, but in any case this is a serious problem as it may lead to the next
		problem, data corruption.

	    </indexterm>
		Data corruption is one of the most serious problems. It leads to uncertainty, anger, and 
		frustration, and generally precipitates immediate corrective demands. Management response
		to this type of problem may be rational, as well as highly irrational. There have been
		cases where management has fired network staff for permitting this situation to occur without 
		immediate correction. There have been situations where perfectly functional hardware was thrown 
		out and replaced, only to find the problem caused by a low-cost network hardware item. There 
		have been cases where server operating systems were replaced, or where Samba was updated, 
		only to later isolate the problem due to defective client software.

	In this chapter, you can work through a number of measures that significantly arm you to
	anticipate and to combat network performance issues. You can work through complex and thorny
	methods to improve the reliability of your network environment, but be warned that all such steps
	demand the price of complexity.

	<title>Introduction</title>

	<para>
	Mr. Bob Jordan just opened an email from Christine that reads:
	</para>

	<para>
	Bob,
	<blockquote><attribution>Christine</attribution><para>
	A few months ago we sat down to design the network. We discussed the challenges ahead and we all
	agreed to compromise our design to keep it simple. We knew there would be problems, but anticipated
	that we would have some time to resolve any issues that might be encountered.
	</para>

	<para>
	As you now know we started off on the wrong foot. We have a lot of unhappy users. One of them
	resigned yesterday afternoon because she was under duress to complete some critical projects. She
	suffered a blue screen of death situation just as she was finishing four hours of intensive work, all
	of which was lost. She has a unique requirement that involves storing large files on her desktop.
	Mary's desktop profile is nearly 1 Gigabyte in size. As a result of her desktop configuration, it
	takes her nearly 15 minutes just to log onto her workstation. But that is not enough. Because all
	network logon traffic passes over the network links between our buildings, logging on may take
	three or four attempts due to blue screen problems associated with network timeouts.
	</para>

	<para>
	A few of us worked to help her out of trouble. We convinced her to stay and promised to fully 
	resolve the difficulties she is facing. We have no choice. We must implement LDAP and set hard 
	limits on what our users can do with their desktops. If we do not do this, we face staff losses 
	that can surely do harm to our growth, as well as to staff morale. I am sure we can better deal 
	with the consequences of what we know we must do than we can with the unrest we have now.
	</para>

	<para>
	Stan and I have discussed the current situation. We are resolved to help our users and protect
	the well being of Abmas. Please acknowledge this advice with consent to proceed as required to
	regain control of our vital IT operations.

	  <primary>network</primary>
	  <secondary>multi-segment</secondary>
	</indexterm>
	Every compromise has consequences. Having a large routed (i.e., multi-segment) network with only a
	single domain controller is a poor design that has obvious operational effects that may
	frustrate users. Here is Bob's reply:
	<blockquote><attribution>Bob</attribution><para>
	Christine, Your diligence and attention to detail are much valued. Stan and I fully support your
	proposals to resolve the issues. I am confident that your plans fully realized will significantly
	boost staff morale. Please go ahead with your plans. If you have any problems, please let me know.
	Please let Stan know what the estimated cost will be so I can approve the expense. Do not wait
	for approval; I appreciate the urgency.

	The implementation of Samba BDCs necessitates the installation and configuration of LDAP.
	For this site, you use OpenLDAP, the open source software LDAP server platform. Commercial

	<para>
	A word of caution is fully in order. OpenLDAP is purely an LDAP server and unlike commercial
	offerings, it requires that you manually edit the server configuration files and manually
	initialize the LDAP directory database. OpenLDAP itself has only command line tools to
	help you to get OpenLDAP and Samba-3 running as required, albeit with some learning curve challenges.

      <para><indexterm>
	  <primary>Active Directory</primary>
	</indexterm>
	For most sites, the deployment of Microsoft Active Directory from the shrink-wrapped installation is quite
	adequate. If you are migrating from Microsoft Active Directory, be
	warned that OpenLDAP does not include
	GUI-based directory management tools. Even a simple task such as adding users to the OpenLDAP database 
	requires an understanding of what you are doing, why you are doing it, and the tools that you must use.

	When installed and configured, an OpenLDAP Identity Management backend for Samba functions well. 
	High availability operation may be obtained through directory replication/synchronization and 
	master/slave server configurations. OpenLDAP is a mature platform to host the organizational 
	directory infrastructure that can include all UNIX accounts, directories for electronic mail, and much more. 
	The price paid through learning how to design an LDAP directory schema in implementation and configuration 
	of management tools is well rewarded by performance and flexibility, and the freedom to manage directory
	contents with greater ability to back up, restore, and modify the directory than is generally possible
	with Microsoft Active Directory.

	A comparison of OpenLDAP with Microsoft Active Directory does not do justice to either. OpenLDAP is an LDAP directory
	tool-set. Microsoft Active Directory Server is an implementation of an LDAP server that is largely pre-configured
	for a specific task orientation. It comes with a set of administrative tools that is entirely customized
	for the purpose of running MS Windows applications that include file and print services, Microsoft Exchange
	server, Microsoft SQL server, and more. The complexity of OpenLDAP is highly valued by the UNIX administrator
	who wants to built a custom directory solution. Microsoft Active Directory is a generic LDAP server that has
	been pre-configured for a specific task. Microsoft provides an application called 
	<ulink url="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/adam/default.mspx">
	MS ADAM</ulink> that provides more-generic LDAP services, yet it does not have the vanilla-like services
	of OpenLDAP.

	You may wish to consider outsourcing the development of your OpenLDAP directory to an expert, particularly
	if you find the challenge of learning about LDAP directories, schemas, configuration, and management
	tools, and the creation of shell and Perl scripts a bit
	challenging. OpenLDAP can be easily customized, though it includes
	many ready-to-use schemas. Samba-3 provides an OpenLDAP schema file
	that is required for use as a passdb backend.
	</para>

	<para>
	For those who are willing to brave the process of installing and configuring LDAP and Samba-3 interoperability,
	there are a few nice Web-based tools that may help you to manage your users and groups more effectively.
	The Web-based tools you might like to consider include: The <ulink

	Account Manager</ulink> (LAM), as well as the <ulink

	<ulink url="http://webmin.idealx.org/index.en.html">CGI tools.</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
	Some additional LDAP tools should be mentioned. Every so often a Samba user reports using one of 
	these so it may be useful to include passing reference to them. 
	The first is <ulink url="http://biot.com/gq">GQ</ulink>, a GTK-ased LDAP browser; 
	LDAP <ulink url="http://www.iit.edu/~gawojar/ldap/">Browser/Editor,</ulink>

	<note><para>
	The following prescriptive guidance is not an LDAP tutorial. The LDAP implementation expressly lacks
	security. No form of secure LDAP communications is attempted. The LDAP configuration information provided
	is considered to consist of the barest essentials only. You are strongly encouraged to learn more about
	LDAP before attempting to deploy it in a business-critical environment.

	Mary's problems are due to two factors. First, the absence of a domain controller on the local network is the
	main cause of the errors that result in blue screen crashes. Second, Mary has a large profile that must
	be loaded over the wide-area network connection. This addition of BDCs on each network segment significantly
	improves overall network performance for most users, but this is not enough. You must gain control over
	user desktops, and this must be done in a way that wins their support and does not cause further loss of
	staff morale. The following procedures solve this problem.

	There is also an opportunity to implement smart printing features. You add this to the Samba configuration
	so that future printer changes can be managed without need to change desktop configurations.

	<para>
	You add the ability to automatically download new printer drivers, even if they are not installed 
	in the default desktop profile. Only one example of printing configuration is given. It is assumed that

	The use of LDAP with Samba-3 makes it necessary to store UNIX accounts as well as Windows Networking

	<ulink url="http://www.padl.com/Contents/OpenSourceSoftware.html">PADL LDAP tools.</ulink> The resolution 
	of the UNIX group name to its GID must be enabled from either the
	  <filename>/etc/group</filename> 
	or from the LDAP backend. This requires the use of the PADL <filename>nss_ldap</filename> toolset
	that integrates with the name service switcher (NSS). The same requirements exist for resolution
	of the UNIX username to the UID. The relationships are demonstrated in <link linkend="ch6-LDAPdiag"/>.

		<para>
		As XP roaming profiles grow, so does the amount of time it takes to log in and out.

	    </indexterm>
		An XP Roaming Profile consists of the <constant>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</constant> hive file
		<filename>NTUSER.DAT</filename> and a number of folders (My Documents, Application Data,
		Desktop, Start Menu, Templates, NetHood, Favorites, and so on).  When a user logs onto the 
		network with the default configuration of MS Windows NT/200x/XPP, all this data is 
		copied to the local machine. By default it is copied to the local machine, under the
		<filename>C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%</filename> directory. While the user is logged in, 
		any changes made to any of these folders or to the <constant>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</constant> 
		branch of the registry are made to the local copy of the profile.  At logout the profile 
		data is copied back to the server. This behavior can be changed through appropriate
		registry changes and/or through changes to the Default User profile. In the latter case,
		it updates the registry with the values that are set in the
	    profile <filename>NTUSER.DAT</filename>
		file.
		</para>

		<para>
		The first challenge is to reduce the amount of data that must be transferred to and 
		from the profile server as roaming profiles are processed.  This includes removing 
		all the shortcuts in the Recent directory, making sure the cache used by the web browser 
		is not being dumped into the <filename>Application Data</filename> folder, removing the 
		Java plug-in's cache (the .jpi_cache directory in the profile), as well as training the 
		user to not place large files on the Desktop and to use his mapped home directory for
		saving documents instead of the <filename>My Documents</filename> folder.
		</para>

	  <para><indexterm>
	      <primary>My Documents</primary>
	    </indexterm>
		Using a folder other than <filename>My Documents</filename> is a nuisance for

	    The secret to rapid loading of roaming profiles is to prevent unnecessary data from 
		being copied back and forth, without losing any functionality. This is not difficult; 
		it can be done by making changes to the Local Group Policy on each client as well 
		as changing some paths in each user's <filename>NTUSER.DAT</filename> hive.

		user's profile. Then just create a Network Default Profile. Of course, it is
		necessary to copy all files from redirected folders to the network share to which

		The subject of printing is quite topical. Printing problems run second place to name
		resolution issues today. So far in this book, you have experienced only what is generally
		known as <quote>dumb</quote> printing. Dumb printing is the arrangement where all drivers
		are manually installed on each client and the printing subsystems perform no filtering
		or intelligent processing. Dumb printing is easily understood. It usually works without
		many problems, but it has its limitations also. Dumb printing is better known as
		<command>Raw Print Through</command> printing.

	    </indexterm>
		Samba permits the configuration of <command>Smart</command> printing using the Microsoft
		Windows point-and-click (also called drag-and-drop) printing. What this provides is
		essentially the ability to print to any printer. If the local client does not yet have a
		driver installed, the driver is automatically downloaded from the Samba server and
		installed on the client. Drag-and-drop printing is neat; it means the user never needs
		to fuss with driver installation, and that is a <trademark>Good Thing</trademark>,
		isn't it?
		</para>

		<para>
		There is a further layer of print job processing that is known as <command>Intelligent</command>
		printing that automatically senses the file format of data submitted for printing and
		then invokes a suitable print filter to convert the incoming data stream into a format
		suited to the printer to which the job is dispatched.

		The CUPS printing subsystem is capable of intelligent printing. It has the capacity to
		detect the data format and apply a print filter. This means that it is feasible to install
		on all Windows clients a single printer driver for use with all printers that are routed
		through CUPS. The most sensible driver to use is one for a Postscript printer. Fortunately,
		<ulink url="http://www.easysw.com">Easy Software Products,</ulink> the authors of CUPS have
		released a Postscript printing driver for Windows. It can be installed into the Samba
		printing backend so that it automatically downloads to the client when needed. 
		</para>

		<para>
		This means that so long as there is a CUPS driver for the printer, all printing from Windows 
		software can use Postscript, no matter what the actual printer language for the physical 
		device is. It also means that the administrator can swap out a printer with a totally 
		different type of device without ever needing to change a client workstation driver.
		</para>

		<para>
		This book is about Samba-3, so you can confine the printing style to just the smart
		style of installation. Those interested in further information regarding intelligent
		printing should review documentation on the Easy Software Products Web site.

		For PAM LDAP configuration on this SUSE Linux 9.0 system, the simplest solution is to edit the following
		files in the <filename>/etc/pam.d</filename> directory:
	      <command>login, password, samba, sshd</command>.
		In each file, locate every entry that has the <command>pam_unix2.so</command> entry and add to the
		line the entry <command>use_ldap</command> as shown for the
	      <command>login</command> module in
		this example:
<screen>
#%PAM-1.0
auth      requisite  pam_unix2.so   nullok use_ldap #set_secrpc
auth      required   pam_securetty.so
auth      required   pam_nologin.so
#auth     required   pam_homecheck.so
auth      required   pam_env.so
auth      required   pam_mail.so
account   required   pam_unix2.so   use_ldap
password  required   pam_pwcheck.s  nullok
password  required   pam_unix2.so   nullok use_first_pass \
                                    use_authtok use_ldap

session   required   pam_limits.so
</screen>
		</para>

	    <para><indexterm>
		<primary>pam_ldap.so</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		On other Linux systems that do not have an LDAP-enabled <command>pam_unix2.so</command> module,
		you must edit these files by adding the <command>pam_ldap.so</command> modules as shown here:
<screen>
#%PAM-1.0
auth     required    pam_securetty.so
auth     required    pam_nologin.so
auth     sufficient  pam_ldap.so
auth     required    pam_unix2.so   nullok try_first_pass #set_secrpc
account  sufficient  pam_ldap.so
account  required    pam_unix2.so
password required    pam_pwcheck.so nullok
password required    pam_ldap.so    use_first_pass use_authtok
password required    pam_unix2.so   nullok use_first_pass use_authtok
session  required    pam_unix2.so   none # debug or trace
session  required    pam_limits.so
session  required    pam_env.so
session  optional    pam_mail.so
</screen>
		This example does have the LDAP-enabled <command>pam_unix2.so</command>, but simply
		demonstrates the use of the <command>pam_ldap.so</command> module. You can use either
		implementation, but if the <command>pam_unix2.so</command> on your system supports
		LDAP, you probably want to use it, rather than add an additional module.

</screen>
		If, after a short delay (a few seconds), the Domain SID has still not been written to

	<title>LDAP Initialization and Creation of User and Group Accounts</title>

	<para>
	The LDAP database must be populated with well-known Windows Domain user accounts and Domain Group 
	accounts before Samba can be used. The following procedures step you through the process.
	</para>

	<para>
	At this time, Samba-3 requires that on a PDC all UNIX (Posix) group accounts that are
	mapped (linked) to Windows Domain Group accounts must be in the LDAP database. It does not
	hurt to have UNIX user and group accounts in both the system files as well as in the LDAP
	database. From a UNIX system perspective, the NSS resolver checks system files before
	referring to LDAP. If the UNIX system can resolve (find) an account in the system file, it
	does not need to ask LDAP.
	</para>

	<para>
	Addition of an account to the LDAP backend can be done in a number of ways:
	</para>

	<blockquote><para><indexterm>
	      <primary>NIS</primary>
	    </indexterm><indexterm>

	    </indexterm><indexterm>
	      <primary>PosixAccount</primary>
	    </indexterm>
	If you always have a user account in the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> on every 
	server or in a NIS(+) backend, it is not necessary to add Posix accounts for them in 
	LDAP. In this case, you can add Windows Domain user accounts using the 
	<command>pdbedit</command> utility. Use of this tool from the command line adds the 
	SambaSamAccount entry for the user, but does not add the PosixAccount entry for the user.
	</para>

	<para>
	If you decide that it is probably a good idea to add both the PosixAccount attributes
	as well as the SambaSamAccount attributes for each user, then a suitable script is needed.
	In the example system you are installing in this exercise, you are making use of the
	Idealx smbldap-tools scripts. A copy of these tools, pre-configured for this system,
	is included on the enclosed CD-ROM under <filename>Chap06/Tools.</filename>
	</para></blockquote>

	<para><indexterm>
	    <primary>Idealx</primary>
	    <secondary>smbldap-tools</secondary>

	If you wish to have more control over how the LDAP database is initialized or

	    linkend="altldapcfg"/>.
	</para>

	<para><indexterm>
	    <primary>smbldap-populate.pl</primary>
	  </indexterm>
	The following steps initialize the LDAP database, and then you can add user and group
	accounts that Samba can use. You use the <command>smbldap-populate.pl</command> to
	seed the LDAP database. You then manually add the accounts shown in <link linkend="ch6-bigacct"/>. 
	The list of users does not cover all 500 network users; it provides examples only.

	      <primary>directory</primary>
	      <secondary>Computers container</secondary>
	    </indexterm>
	In the following examples, as the LDAP database is initialized, we do create a container
	for Computer (machine) accounts. In the Samba-3 &smb.conf; files, specific use is made
	of the People container, not the Computers container, for domain member accounts. This is not a
	mistake; it is a deliberate action that is necessitated by the fact that there is a bug in Samba-3
	that prevents it from being able to search the LDAP database for computer accounts if they are
	placed in the Computers container. By placing all machine accounts in the People container, we
	are able to side-step this bug. It is expected that at some time in the future this problem will
	be resolved. At that time, it will be possible to use the Computers container in order to keep
	machine accounts separate from user accounts.

		So that we can use a global IDMAP repository the LDAP directory must have a container object for IDMAP data. 
		There are several ways you can check that your LDAP database is able to receive IDMAP information. One of 
		the simplest is to execute:
<screen>
&rootprompt; slapcat | grep -i idmap
dn: ou=Idmap,dc=abmas,dc=biz
ou: idmap
</screen>
	      <indexterm>
		<primary>ldapadd</primary>
	      </indexterm>
	        If the execution of this command does not return IDMAP entries, you need to create an LDIF
		template file (see <link linkend="ch6-ldifadd"/>). You can add the required entries using 
		the following command:
<screen>
&rootprompt; ldapadd -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=abmas,dc=biz" \
		-w not24get &lt; /etc/openldap/idmap.LDIF
</screen>
		Samba automatically populates this LDAP directory container when it needs to.
		</para></step>

	  <step><para><indexterm>
		<primary>slapcat</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		It looks like all has gone well, as expected. Let's confirm that this is the case
		by running a few tests. First we check the contents of the database directly
		by running <command>slapcat</command> as follows (the output has been cut down):
<screen>
&rootprompt; slapcat

		This looks good so far.
		</para></step>

	  <step><para><indexterm>
		<primary>ldapsearch</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		The next step is to prove that the LDAP server is running and responds to a
		search request. Execute the following as shown (output has been cut to save space):
<screen>
&rootprompt; ldapsearch -x -b "dc=abmas,dc=biz" "(ObjectClass=*)"

	  <step><para><indexterm>

		You must now make certain that the NSS resolver can interrogate LDAP also.
		Execute the following commands:
<screen>
&rootprompt; getent passwd | grep Administrator

</screen><indexterm>
		<primary>nss_ldap</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		This demonstrates that the <command>nss_ldap</command> library is functioning
		as it should.
		</para></step>

	  <step><para><indexterm>
		<primary>smbldap-useradd.pl</primary>
	      </indexterm><indexterm>
		<primary>smbldap-passwd.pl</primary>
	      </indexterm><indexterm>
		<primary>smbpasswd</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		Our database is now ready for the addition of network users. For each user for
		whom an account must be created, execute the following:
<screen>
&rootprompt; ./smbldap-useradd.pl -m -a <constant>username</constant>
&rootprompt; ./smbldap-passwd.pl <constant>username</constant>
Changing password for <constant>username</constant>
New password : XXXXXXXX
Retype new password : XXXXXXXX

&rootprompt; smbpasswd <constant>username</constant>
New SMB password: XXXXXXXX
Retype new SMB password: XXXXXXXX
</screen>
		Where <constant>username</constant> is the login ID for each user.
		</para></step>

	  <step><para><indexterm>
		<primary>getent</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		Now verify that the UNIX (Posix) accounts can be resolved via NSS by executing the
		following:
<screen>
&rootprompt; getent passwd
...
Administrator:x:998:512:Netbios Domain Administrator:/home:/bin/false
nobody:x:999:514:nobody:/dev/null:/bin/false
bobj:x:1000:513:System User:/home/bobj:/bin/bash
stans:x:1001:513:System User:/home/stans:/bin/bash
chrisr:x:1002:513:System User:/home/chrisr:/bin/bash
maryv:x:1003:513:System User:/home/maryv:/bin/bash

&rootprompt; id chrisr
uid=1002(chrisr) gid=513(Domain Users) groups=513(Domain Users)
</screen>
		This confirms that the UNIX (Posix) user accounts can be resolved from LDAP.
		</para></step>

	  <step><para><indexterm>
		<primary>smbldap-usermod.pl</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		In the above listing, you can see that the user <constant>Administrator</constant>
		has been given UID=998. This means that operations conducted from a Windows client
		using tools such as the Domain User Manager fails under UNIX because the
		management of user and group accounts requires that the UID=0. You decide to rectify 
		this immediately as demonstrated here:
<screen>
&rootprompt; cd /var/lib/samba/sbin
&rootprompt; ./smbldap-usermod.pl -u 0 Administrator
</screen>
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		Make certain that a home directory has been created for every user by listing the
		directories in <filename>/home</filename> as follows:
<screen>
&rootprompt; ls -al /home
drwxr-xr-x   8 root   root         176 Dec 17 18:50 ./
drwxr-xr-x  21 root   root         560 Dec 15 22:19 ../
drwx------   7 bobj   Domain Users     568 Dec 17 01:16 bobj/

drwx------   7 maryv  Domain Users     568 Dec 17 01:27 maryv/
drwx------   7 stans  Domain Users     568 Dec 17 01:43 stans/
</screen>
		This is precisely what we want to see.
		</para></step>

	  <step><para><indexterm>
		<primary>ldapsam</primary>
	      </indexterm><indexterm>
		<primary>pdbedit</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		The final validation step involves making certain that Samba-3 can obtain the user
		accounts from the LDAP ldapsam passwd backend. Execute the following command as shown:
<screen>
&rootprompt; pdbedit -Lv chrisr
Unix username:        chrisr
NT username:          chrisr
Account Flags:        [U          ]
User SID:             S-1-5-21-3504140859-1010554828-2431957765-3004
Primary Group SID:    S-1-5-21-3504140859-1010554828-2431957765-513

</screen>
		This looks good. Of course, you fully expected that it would all work, didn't you?
		</para></step>

	  <step><para><indexterm>
		<primary>smbldap-groupadd.pl</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		Now you add the group accounts that are used on the Abmas network. Execute
		the following exactly as shown:
<screen>
&rootprompt; ./smbldap-groupadd.pl -a Accounts
&rootprompt; ./smbldap-groupadd.pl -a Finances
&rootprompt; ./smbldap-groupadd.pl -a PIOps
</screen>
		The addition of groups does not involve keyboard interaction, so the lack of console
		output is of no concern.
		</para></step>

	  <step><para><indexterm>
		<primary>getent</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		You really do want to confirm that UNIX group resolution from LDAP is functioning 
		as it should. Let's do this as shown here:
<screen>
&rootprompt; getent group
...
Domain Admins:x:512:Administrator
Domain Users:x:513:bobj,stans,chrisr,maryv
Domain Guests:x:514:
...
Accounts:x:1000:
Finances:x:1001:
PIOps:x:1002:
</screen>
		The well-known special accounts (Domain Admins, Domain Users, Domain Guests), as well
		as our own site-specific group accounts, are correctly listed. This is looking good.
		</para></step>

	  <step><para><indexterm>
		<primary>net</primary>
		<secondary>groupmap</secondary>
		<tertiary>list</tertiary>
	      </indexterm>
		The final step we need to validate is that Samba can see all the Windows Domain Groups
		and that they are correctly mapped to the respective UNIX group account. To do this,
		just execute the following command:
<screen>
&rootprompt; net groupmap list
Domain Admins (S-1-5-21-3504140859-...-2431957765-512) -> Domain Admins
Domain Users (S-1-5-21-3504140859-...-2431957765-513) -> Domain Users
Domain Guests (S-1-5-21-3504140859-...-2431957765-514) -> Domain Guests
...
Accounts (S-1-5-21-3504140859-1010554828-2431957765-3001) -> Accounts
Finances (S-1-5-21-3504140859-1010554828-2431957765-3003) -> Finances
PIOps (S-1-5-21-3504140859-1010554828-2431957765-3005) -> PIOps
</screen>
		This is looking good. Congratulations &smbmdash; it works! Note that in the above output
		the lines where shortened by replacing the middle value (1010554828) of the SID with the 
		elipsis (...).
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		The server you have so carefully built is now ready for another important step. You 
		start the Samba-3 server and validate its operation. Execute the following to render all 
		the processes needed fully operative so that, on system reboot, they are automatically 
		started:
<screen>
&rootprompt; chkconfig named on
&rootprompt; chkconfig dhcpd on
&rootprompt; chkconfig ldap on
&rootprompt; chkconfig nmb on
&rootprompt; chkconfig smb on
&rootprompt; chkconfig winbind on
&rootprompt; rcnmb start
&rootprompt; rcsmb start
&rootprompt; rcwinbind start
</screen>
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		The next step might seem a little odd at this point, but take note that you are about to
		start <command>winbindd</command> which must be able to authenticate to the PDC via the
		localhost interface. This requires a Domain account for the PDC. This account can be
		easily created by joining the PDC to the Domain by executing the following command:
<screen>
&rootprompt; net rpc join -U Administrator%not24get
Joined domain MEGANET2.
</screen>
		This indicates that the Domain security account for the BDC has been correctly created.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		At this time it is necessary to restart <command>winbindd</command> so that it can
		correctly authenticate to the PDC. The following command achieves that:
<screen>
&rootprompt; rcwinbind restart
</screen>
		</para></step>

	  <step><para><indexterm>
		<primary>smbclient</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		You may now check Samba-3 operation as follows:
<screen>
&rootprompt; smbclient -L massive -U%

		You must now set the LDAP administrative password into the
	    Samba-3 <filename>secrets.tdb</filename>
		file by executing this command:
<screen>
&rootprompt; smbpasswd -w not24get
Setting stored password for "cn=Manager,dc=abmas,dc=biz" in secrets.tdb
</screen>
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		Now you must obtain the Domain Security Identifier from the PDC and store it into the
		<filename>secrets.tdb</filename> file also. This step is not necessary with an LDAP
		passdb backend because Samba-3 obtains the Domain SID from the 
		sambaDomain object it automatically stores in the LDAP backend. It does not hurt to
		add the SID to the <filename>secrets.tdb</filename>, and if you wish to do so, this 
		command can achieve that:
<screen>
&rootprompt; net rpc getsid MEGANET2
Storing SID S-1-5-21-3504140859-1010554828-2431957765 \
                           for Domain MEGANET2 in secrets.tdb
</screen>
		When configuring a Samba-3 BDC that has an LDAP backend, there is no need to take
		any special action to join it to the Domain. However, winbind communicates with the
		Domain Controller that is running on the localhost and must be able to authenticate,
		thus requiring that the BDC should be joined to the Domain. The process of joining
		the Domain creates the necessary authentication accounts.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		To join the Samba BDC to the Domain execute the following:
<screen>
&rootprompt; net rpc join -U Administrator%not24get
Joined domain MEGANET2.
</screen>
		This indicates that the Domain security account for the BDC has been correctly created.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>

                The server you have so carefully built is now ready for another important step. Now
                start the Samba-3 server and validate its operation. Execute the following to render all
                the processes needed fully operative so that, upon system reboot, they are automatically

		Your new <constant>BLDG1, BLDG2</constant> servers do not have home directories for users.
		To rectify this using the SUSE yast2 utility or by manually
	    editing the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>
		file, add a mount entry to mount the <constant>home</constant> directory that has been exported
		from the <constant>MASSIVE</constant> server. Mount this resource before proceeding. An alternate
		approach could be to create local home directories for users who are to use these machines.
		This is a choice that you, as system administrator, must make. The following entry in the
		<filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file suffices for now:
<screen>
massive.abmas.biz:/home  /home  nfs     rw 0 0
</screen>
		To mount this resource, execute:
<screen>
&rootprompt; mount -a
</screen>
		Verify that the home directory has been mounted as follows:
<screen>
&rootprompt; df | grep home

	My father would say, <quote>Dinner is not over until the dishes have been done.</quote>
	The makings of a great network environment take a lot of effort and attention to detail.
	So far you have completed most of the complex (and to many administrators, the interesting
	part of server configuration) steps, but remember to tie it all together. Here are
	a few more steps that must be completed so that your network runs like a well-rehearsed
	orchestra.
	</para>

	<sect2>
	<title>Configuring Directory Share Point Roots</title>

	<para>
	In your &smb.conf; file, you have specified Windows shares. Each has a
	  <parameter>path</parameter>
	parameter. Even though it is obvious to all, one of the common Samba networking problems is
	caused by forgetting to verify that every such share root directory actually exists and that it
	has the necessary permissions and ownership.
	</para>

	<para>
	Here is an example, but remember to create the directory needed for every share:
<screen>
&rootprompt; mkdir -p /data/{accounts,finsvcs,piops}
&rootprompt; mkdir -p /apps
&rootprompt; chown -R root.root /data
&rootprompt; chown -R root.root /apps

&rootprompt; chown -R bobj.Finances /data/finsvcs

	<title>Configuring Profile Directories</title>

	<para>
	You made a conscious decision to do everything it would take to improve network client
	performance. One of your decisions was to implement folder redirection. This means that Windows
	user desktop profiles are now made up of two components &smbmdash; a dynamically loaded part and a set of file
	network folders.

	<para>
	For this arrangement to work, every user needs a directory structure for the network folder
	portion of their profile as shown here:
<screen>
&rootprompt; mkdir -p /var/lib/samba/profdata
&rootprompt; chown root.root /var/lib/samba/profdata
&rootprompt; chmod 755 /var/lib/samba/profdata

	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	  Mandatory profiles cannot be overwritten by a user. The change from
	  a user profile to a mandatory profile is effected by renaming the
	  <filename>NTUSER.DAT</filename> to
	  <filename>NTUSER.MAN</filename>, i.e., just by changing the filename
	  extension.

	The location of the profile that a user can obtain is set in the users' account in the LDAP passdb backend.
	You can manage this using the Idealx smbldap-tools or using the 
	<ulink url="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/SRVTOOLS.EXE">Windows NT4 Domain User Manager.</ulink>
	</para>

	<para>
	It may not be obvious that you must ensure that the root directory for the user's profile exists
	and has the needed permissions. Use the following commands to create this directory:
<screen>
&rootprompt; mkdir -p /var/lib/samba/profiles/<emphasis>username</emphasis>
&rootprompt; chown <emphasis>username</emphasis>.Domain\ Users

	<title>Preparation of Logon Scripts</title>

	<para><indexterm>
	    <primary>logon script</primary>
	  </indexterm>
	The use of a logon script with Windows XP Professional is an option that every site should consider.
	Unless you have locked down the desktop so the user cannot change anything, there is risk that
	a vital network drive setting may be broken or that printer connections may be lost. Logon scripts
	can help to restore persistent network folder (drive) and printer connections in a predictable
	manner. One situation in which such breakage may occur in particular is when a mobile PC (notebook)
	user attaches to another company's network that forces environment changes that are alien to your
	network.
	</para>

	<para>
	If you decide to use network logon scripts, by reference to the &smb.conf; files for the Domain
	Controllers, you see that the path to the share point for the
	  <constant>NETLOGON</constant>
	share defined is <filename>/var/lib/samba/netlogon</filename>. The path defined for the logon
	script inside that share is <filename>scripts\logon.bat</filename>. This means that as a Windows
	NT/200x/XP client logs onto the network, it tries to obtain the file
	  <filename>logon.bat</filename>
	from the fully qualified path <filename>/var/lib/samba/netlogon/scripts</filename>. This fully
	qualified path should, therefore, exist whether you install the
	  <filename>logon.bat</filename>.
	</para>

	<para>
	You can, of course, create the fully qualified path by executing:
<screen>
&rootprompt; mkdir -p /var/lib/samba/netlogon/scripts
</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	You should research the options for logon script implementation by referring to <emphasis>TOSHARG</emphasis>, Chapter 21,
	Section 21.4. A quick Web search will bring up a host of options. One of the most popular logon
	facilities in use today is called <ulink url="http://www.kixtart.org">KiXtart.</ulink>

	<title>Key Points Learned</title>

	<para>
	This chapter has introduced many new concepts. Is it a sad fact that the example presented deliberately
	avoided any consideration of security. Security does not just happen; you must design it into your total
	network. Security begins with a systems design and implementation that anticipates hostile behavior from
	users both inside and outside the organization. Hostile and malicious intruders do not respect barriers;
	they accept them as challenges. For that reason, if not simply from a desire to establish safe networking
	practices, you must not deploy the design presented in this book in an environment where there is risk
	of compromise.

	</indexterm>
	As a minimum, the LDAP server must be protected by way of Access Control Lists (ACLs) and it must be
	configured to use secure protocols for all communications over the network. Of course, secure networking
	does not result just from systems design and implementation but involves constant user education
	training, and above all disciplined attention to detail and constant searching for signs of unfriendly
	or alien activities. Security is itself a topic for a whole book. Please do consult appropriate sources.

	<title>Questions and Answers</title>

	<para>
	Well, here we are at the end of this chapter and we have only ten questions to help you to
	remember so much. There are bound to be some sticky issues here.
	</para>

	<qandaset defaultlabel="chap06qa">
	<qandaentry>
	<question>

		<para>
		Why did you not cover secure practices? Isn't it rather irresponsible to instruct
		network administrators to implement insecure solutions?
		</para>

	</question>
	<answer>

		<para>
		Let's get this right. This is a book about Samba, not about OpenLDAP and secure
		communication protocols for subjects other than Samba. Earlier on, you note
		that the Dynamic DNS and DHCP solutions also used no protective secure communications
		protocols. The reason for this is simple: There are so many ways of implementing
		secure protocols that this book would have been even larger and more complex.
		</para>

		<para>
		The solutions presented here all work (at least they did for me). Network administrators
		have the interest and the need to be better trained and instructed in secure networking
		practices and ought to implement safe systems. I made the decision, right or wrong,
		to keep this material as simple as possible. The intent of this book is to demonstrate
		a working solution and not to discuss too many peripheral issues.
		</para>

		<para>
		This book makes little mention of backup techniques. Does that mean that I am recommending
		that you should implement a network without provision for data recovery and for disaster
		management? Back to our focus: The deployment of Samba has been clearly demonstrated.
		</para>

	</answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	<question>

		<para>
		You have focused much on SUSE Linux and little on the market leader, Red Hat. Do
		you have a problem with Red Hat Linux? Doesn't that make your guidance irrelevant
		to the Linux I might be using?
		</para>

	</question>
	<answer>

		<para>
		Both Red Hat Linux and SUSE Linux comply with the Linux Standards Base specifications
		for a standard Linux distribution. The differences are marginal. Surely you know
		your Linux platform and you do have access to administration manuals for it. This
		book is not a Linux tutorial; it is a Samba tutorial. Let's keep the focus on
		the Samba part of the book; all the other bits are peripheral (but important) to
		creation of a total network solution. 
		</para>

		<para>
		What I find interesting is the attention reviewers give to Linux installation and to
		the look and feel of the desktop, but does that make for a great server? In this book,
		I have paid particular attention to the details of creating a whole solution framework.
		I have not tightened every nut and bolt, but I have touched on all the issues you
		need to be familiar with. Over the years many people have approached me wanting to
		know the details of exactly how to implement a DHCP and Dynamic DNS server with Samba
		and WINS. In this chapter, it is plain to see what needs to be configured to provide
		transparent interoperability. Likewise for CUPS and Samba interoperation. These are
		key stumbling areas for many people.
		</para>

		<para>
		At every critical junction, I have provided comparative guidance for both SUSE and
		Red Hat Linux. Both manufacturers have done a great job in furthering the cause
		of open source software. I favor neither and respect both. I like particular
		features of both products (companies also). No bias in presentation is intended.
		Oh, before I forget, I particularly like Debian Linux; that is my favorite playground.

	<question>

		<para>
		You did not use SWAT to configure Samba. Is there something wrong with it?
		</para>

	</question>
	<answer>

		<para>
		That is a good question. As it is, the &smb.conf; file configurations are presented
		in as direct a format as possible. Adding SWAT into the equation would have complicated
		matters. I sought simplicity of implementation. The fact is that I did use SWAT to
		create the files in the first place.
		</para>

		<para>
		There are people in the Linux and open source community who feel that SWAT is dangerous
		and insecure. Many will not touch it with a barge-pole. By not introducing SWAT, I
		hope to have brought their interests on board. SWAT is well covered is <emphasis>TOSHARG</emphasis>.

	<question>

		<para>
		You have exposed a well-used password <emphasis>not24get</emphasis>. Is that
		not irresponsible? 
		</para>

	</question>
	<answer>

		<para>
		Well, I had to use a password of some sort. At least this one has been consistently
		used throughout. I guess you can figure out that in a real deployment it would make 
		sense to use a more secure and original password.
		</para>

	</answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	<question>

		<para>
		The Idealx smbldap-tools create many domain group accounts that are not used. Is that
		a good thing?
		</para>

	</question>
	<answer>

		<para>
		I took this up with Idealx and found them most willing to change that in the next version.
		Let's give Idealx some credit for the contribution they have made. I appreciate their work
		and, besides, it does no harm to create accounts that are not now used as at some time 
		Samba may well use them.
		</para>

	</answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	<question>

		<para>
		Can I use LDAP just for Samba accounts and not for UNIX system accounts?
		</para>

	</question>
	<answer>

		<para>
		Yes, you can do that for user accounts only. Samba requires there to be a Posix (UNIX)
		group account for every Windows Domain group account. But if you put your users into
		the system password account, how do you plan to keep all domain controller system
		password files in sync? I think that having everything in LDAP makes a lot of sense
		for the UNIX admin who is still learning the craft and is migrating from MS Windows.
		</para>

	</answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	<question>

		<para>
		Why are the Windows Domain RID portions not the same as the UNIX UID?
		</para>

	</question>
	<answer>

		<para>
		Samba uses a well-known public algorithm for assigning RIDs from UIDs and GIDs.
		This algorithm ought to ensure that there will be no clashes with well-known RIDs.
		Well-known RIDs have special significance to MS Windows clients. The automatic
		assignment used the calculation: RID = UID x 2 + 1000. Of course, Samba does
		permit you to override that to some extent. See the &smb.conf; man page entry
		for <parameter>algorithmic rid base</parameter>.
		</para>

	</answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	<question>

		<para>
		Printer configuration examples all show printing to the HP port 9100. Does this
		mean that I must have HP printers for these solutions to work?
		</para>

	</question>
	<answer>

		<para>
		No. You can use any type of printer and must use the interfacing protocol supported
		by the printer. Many networks use LPR/LPD print servers to which are attached
		PCL printers, InkJet printers, plotters, and so on. At home I use a USB attached
		Inject printer. Use the appropriate device URI (Universal Resource Interface)
		argument to the <constant>lpadmin -v</constant> option that is right for your
		printer.
		</para>

	</answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	<question>

		<para>
		Is folder redirection dangerous? I've heard that you can lose your data that way.
		</para>

	</question>
	<answer>

		<para>
		The only loss of data I know of that involved folder redirection was caused by
		manual misuse of the redirection tool. The administrator redirected a folder to
		a network drive and said he wanted to migrate (move) the data over. Then he 
		changed his mind, so he moved the folder back to the roaming profile. This time,
		he declined to move the data because he thought it was still in the local profile
		folder. That was not the case, so by declining to move the data back, he wiped out
		the data. You cannot hold the tool responsible for that. Caveat emptor still applies.
		</para>

	</answer>
	</qandaentry>

	<qandaentry>
	<question>

		<para>
		Is it really necessary to set a local Group Policy to exclude the redirected
		folders from the roaming profile?
		</para>

	</question>
	<answer>

		<para>
		Yes. If you do not do this, the data will still be copied from the network folder
		(share) to the local cached copy of the profile.
		</para>

	</answer>
