	<para>If set to yes, this parameter activates the support for nested
                 groups. Nested groups are also called local groups or
                 aliases. They work like their counterparts in Windows: Nested
                 groups are defined locally on any machine (they are shared
                 between DC's through their SAM) and can contain users and
                 global groups from any trusted SAM. To be able to use nested
                 groups, you need to run nss_winbind.</para>
		 <para>Please note that per 3.0.3 this is a new feature, so 
		 handle with care.</para>
