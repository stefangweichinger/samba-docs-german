	<para>This parameter is designed to allow Samba servers that
	are members of a Samba controlled domain to use UNIX accounts
	distributed via NIS, rsync, or LDAP as the uid's for winbindd users
	in the hosts primary domain.  Therefore, the user DOMAIN\user1 would
	be mapped to the account user1 in /etc/passwd instead of allocating
	a new uid for him or her.
