        <para>This sets the NetBIOS name by which a Samba 
	server is known. By default it is the same as the first component 
	of the host's DNS name. If a machine is a browse server or
	logon server this name (or the first component
	of the hosts DNS name) will be the name that these services are
	advertised under.</para>
