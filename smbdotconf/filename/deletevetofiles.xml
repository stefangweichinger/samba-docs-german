	<para>This option is used when Samba is attempting to 
	delete a directory that contains one or more vetoed directories 
	(see the <link linkend="VETOFILES"><parameter moreinfo="none">veto files</parameter></link>
	option).  If this option is set to <constant>no</constant> (the default) then if a vetoed 
	directory contains any non-vetoed files or directories then the 
	directory delete will fail. This is usually what you want.</para>

	<para>If this option is set to <constant>yes</constant>, then Samba 
	will attempt to recursively delete any files and directories within 
	the vetoed directory. This can be useful for integration with file 
	serving systems such as NetAtalk which create meta-files within 
	directories you might normally veto DOS/Windows users from seeing 
	(e.g. <filename moreinfo="none">.AppleDouble</filename>)</para>

	<para>Setting <command moreinfo="none">delete veto files = yes</command> allows these 
	directories to be  transparently deleted when the parent directory 
	is deleted (so long as the user has permissions to do so).</para>
