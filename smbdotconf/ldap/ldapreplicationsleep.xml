	<para>When Samba is asked to write to a read-only LDAP
replica, we are redirected to talk to the read-write master server.
This server then replicates our changes back to the 'local' server,
however the replication might take some seconds, especially over slow
links.  Certain client activities, particularly domain joins, can become
confused by the 'success' that does not immediately change the LDAP
back-end's data.  </para>
        <para>This option simply causes Samba to wait a short time, to
allow the LDAP server to catch up.  If you have a particularly
high-latency network, you may wish to time the LDAP replication with a
network sniffer, and increase this value accordingly.  Be aware that no
checking is performed that the data has actually replicated.</para>
